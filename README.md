# Airbnb-in-Beijing
This project is part of an assignment in Udacity's Data Scientist Term-2 Nanodegree. I downloaded this  public dataset from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/)  and done some analysis of the main dataset focused on one question: **What is the real situation of Airbnb in Beijing?**

## Summary

 I have analyzed data from two parts: **Listings in Beijing** and **Hosts in Beijing**, and got the following conclusions:  

If you have any plans to travel to Beijing recently and you want to  book a listing through Airbnb, please note these suggestions:

- Please avoid the May and October;
- Maybe you can choose the listing in Chaoyang District, which has the most number of listings and relatively fair prices;
- If you want to experience a real local life in Beijing ,please choose the personal host.

## Installing

Anaconda with Python 3.6 was used for completing the project.  All the data is visualized through [PyEcharts-1.1.0](https://pyecharts.org/#/).
